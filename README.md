- 👋 Hi, I’m Kaiko
- 👀 I’m interested in spacial data as  I am a geographer. In particular geopandas and rasterio. Apart from that I was pretty intrigued by the data engineering and automation stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning sequel and pandas in WBS CS Data Science Bootcamp #023
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my final project, that should contain something with spacial data (e.g. in our roller coaster business, we dealt with geographical coordinates for our base cities. Finding any airports in a certain spatial relation between those cities and the airport - that would be a spacail data task).
- 📫 How to reach me: Well, we are on Discord anyway, so just contact me there.
